# Intro
What's up every body. I am Edson Philippe a software engineer whose mission is to share his experience with you. The topic of today's 
short talk is: My experience of taking OSMCS Graduate algorithm class for the first time.

If you are not familiar with Graduate Data Structure, It's one of the best classes that you will have to take that actually have an impact in your future. In other word, if you master the totpic of that class, you will be able to solve many interview type question that you get for typical softare engineering roles. I have to start by saying that i have gotten a C on that class and unfortunately, to graduate, I need to at least a B. So, I have to retake it this semester. My goal is not 
to bash the class, but simply to reflect on my mistakes when I was taking it the first time and maybe you can get some values and be mentally be ready for the class when/if you have to take it. 

# Where did I go wrong?
let's dive into some of the mistakes I made when I was taking the course.
1. The first mistake was taking the course during summer with anothor course. This was my first time trying to take 2 courses at the same time and I have learned my lesson. I have to honestly say that it's possible to take more than one classes and be successful, and I have seen other students who had done so, but unfortunatelly, for me, It's not possible. When you have a full time job, a wife and a young kids, it's a completely different stoty than someone who is single with less responsibility. I think what i have learned is that I have a limit and knowing where that line is would make me know what level of commitment I can take. Also, during the summer, the classe is really face paced. And, while some people can do well by seing something the first time and remember everything, I have some limitation in that areas. Usually, when I am faced with new concept, I have to actively review the concept many time before it becomes something I can master. The crush of time durring the summer did not make this possible.
2. The second mistake I made was not to do the homeworks and waited last minute to complete them. Well, I think I was over confident on the amout of time it would take me to complete the homeworks and really understand them.
